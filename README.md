# “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you’ll go.”
― Dr. Seuss



It is considered Illegal to use any image that holds a copyright without that owner’s permission or without purchasing a license that grants that permission. You may never be found out – however you may receive a threatening letter from companies like Getty Images with a lawsuit warning because you’ve illegally used their image on your site. These lawsuits could be $1000’s of dollars per image. No one wants this! But there’s GOOD NEWS – Google offers an Advanced Search option that helps you filter their Google images to only reveal those Google images that are Free License, royalty free, or open to the public for use in any way. These are the images that you’ll want to plug into your blog or website.
